## Loading models to RCE

Machine Learning models are usually shared in different formats, such as ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. These models can be loaded into developers machines or production systems to use them. Usually the models sholdn't contain malicious code, but there are some cases where the model can be used to execute arbitrary code on the system as intended feature or because of a vulnerability in the model loading library.

At the time of the writting these are some examples of this type of vulneravilities:

| **Others** (general)        | *Design flaw* – Pickle serialization                                                                                         | Many ML tools (e.g., pickle-based model formats, Python `pickle.load`) will execute arbitrary code embedded in model files unless mitigated | |


Moreover, there some python pickle based models like the ones used by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security) that can be used to execute arbitrary code on the system if they are not loaded with `weights_only=True`. So, any pickle based model might be specially susceptible to this type of attacks, even if they are not listed in the table above.
